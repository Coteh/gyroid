# Contributing

Welcome to gyroid! There are many opportunities for you, as an open source contributor, to make a valuable contribution to this project. Please read through this Contributing doc for some tips on how to make the most of your contributing experience, and check out the [Issues page](https://github.com/Coteh/gyroid/issues) to get an overview of what tasks need to be worked on.

Please note there is a code of conduct, which can be reviewed at the end of this document. Follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## Tips

### Picking up a Task

1. First discuss the change you wish to make via issue (or if it doesn't yet exist, create a new issue) or by emailing the project team at james.cote.730@gmail.com.
2. Once the project maintainer has assigned the issue to you, you can start work on implementation.

### Pull Request Process

1. Once you finish your implementation, you can create a Pull Request (PR) with details of the implementation and any changes to project structure, dependencies, etc.
   - Other important information that should be mentioned can include any new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.
2. Please create a test plan with your PR as well, with automated tests where appropriate. This ensures reliability and testability of your solution.
3. You may merge the PR once you have the sign-off of the project maintainer, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the project maintainer to merge it for you.

## Code of Conduct

### Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and
orientation.

### Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

### Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

### Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be
further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

### Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the project team at james.cote.730@gmail.com. All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the project's leadership.
